    "user": "You are an expert in Isabelle theorem prover. You will be provided with an Isabelle/ZF code generated by a language model. The provided code has some Isabelle/ZF syntax errors according to the Isabelle prover. You will also be provided with the error details and where the error code is located in the code. Your task is to fix related errors in the provided Isabelle/ZF code with following instructions. Instructions:\n1. Only refine the code part which is related to provided error details. You must keep other code parts unchanged.\n2. The syntax errors might cause by the mismatch of brackets, incorrect using of operators or invalid representation of Isabelle/ZF code. You should only refine the error codes based on the error details by rewriting, fixing or removing error codes.\n3. You should only output tokens that compose the cleaned code. Anything else, including but not limited to note, description, explanation and comment, must be removed from the final answer. Giving any additional text is prohibited.\n4. The cleaned code must have the same style and usage of operators as the original provided code. Operators usually start with \"\\\" such as \"\\<in>\", \"\\<cdot>\". Here are some additional Isabelle/ZF code examples which have the same style as the original provided code:\n{examples_ret}\nStrictly follow the instructions that I have claimed.\nProvided Isabelle/ZF Code:\n{isabelle_code}\n{all_syntax_error}\nRefined Code: ",
