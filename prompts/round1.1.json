Your task is to clean the provided Isabelle code with following instructions. Instructions:\n1. The provided code might contain several lemmas/definitions/theorems. The cleaned code should only have the best one lemma/definition/theorem.\n2. Do not write any proofs and if there are proofs in the provided code, remove it.\n3.The cleaned Isabelle/Isar code must have the same syntax of the original provided code (such as keeping operations like \\<in> \\<cdot>)\n4. The answer should only keep tokens that form the cleaned code, anything else should be removed from the final answer, this includes but not limited to notes, descriptions, explanations and comments.\nStrictly follow the instructions that I have claimed.\nProvided Code:\n{isabelle_code}\nCleaned Code: ",
