Your task is to clean the provided Isabelle/ZF code with following instructions. Instructions:\n1. The provided code might contain several lemmas or definitions or theorems. The cleaned code must only keep the best one lemma or definition or theorem.\n2. Do not write any proof and if there is a proof in the provided code, remove it from the cleaned code.\n3. You should only output tokens that compose the cleaned code. Anything else, including but not limited to note, description, explanation and comment, must be removed from the final answer. Giving any additional text is prohibited.\n4. The cleaned code must have the same style and usage of operators as the original provided code. Operators usually start with \"\\\" such as \"\\<in>\", \"\\<cdot>\".\nStrictly follow the instructions that I have claimed.\nProvided Isabelle/ZF Code: {isabelle_code}\nCleaned Code: ",
