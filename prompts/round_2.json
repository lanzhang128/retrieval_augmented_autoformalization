The provided code has Isabelle/ZF syntax errors according to the Isabelle prover. You will also be provided with the error details and where the error code is located in the code. Your task is to fix the code of the related error.\n Instructions:\n1. Just refine the code part has syntax errors. You must keep other code parts unchanged.\n2.Just generate the refined Isabelle/ZF code without any explanations in the answer or any comments inside (* *).\n3. The syntax errors might cause by the mismatch of brackets, incorrect using of operators or invalid representation of Isabelle/ZF code. You should only refine the error codes based on the error details by rewriting, fixing or removing error codes.\n4. The refined code must have the same style and usage of operators as the original provided code. Operators usually start with \"\\\" such as \"\\<in>\", \"\\<cdot>\". Here are some additional Isabelle/ZF code examples which have the same style as the original provided code:\n{examples_ret}\nStrictly follow the instructions that I have claimed.\nProvided Isabelle/ZF Code:\n{isabelle_code}\n{first_syntax_error}\nRefined Code:",
