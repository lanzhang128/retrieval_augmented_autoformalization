{"informal": " Given that x is strictly smaller than y, and z is an element of the set L, we have that x is related to z by the reflexive and transitive closure relation, and z is related to y by the same relation. In other words, x is related to z and z is related to y imply that x is related to y through the reflexive and transitive closure relation. Similarly, z is related to x and z is related to y imply that z is related to x and z is related to y through the reflexive and transitive closure relation.", "statement": "lemma (in loop1) strict_ord_trans_inv: assumes \"x\\<ls>y\" \"z\\<in>L\"\n  shows \"x\\<ra>z \\<ls> y\\<ra>z\" and \"z\\<ra>x \\<ls> z\\<ra>y\"\n"}
