{"informal": " In the ring0 theory, if J is an element of I, then the set of all elements in V that are mapped to J under the valuation function is equal to the dilatation set D(J), and the former is closed in the latter.\n\nThis lemma states that the set V(J) of all elements in ring0 that map to J under the valuation function (V) is identical to the dilatation set D(J), and this set of elements is closed in D(J). Recall that a set is closed in another set if every limit point of the smaller set belongs to the larger set. The assumptions of this lemma include J being an element of I. The lemma conclusively proves this equality and closure relation by using the definition of a closed set (IsClosed\\_def).", "statement": "lemma (in ring0) V_is_closed:\n  assumes \"J\\<in>\\<I>\"\n  shows \"Spec-V(J) = D(J)\" and \"V(J){is closed in}{D(J).
