{"informal": " A function `f` is a homeomorphism from group `G` to itself, with respect to the substitution `s`, if and only if for all `x` in `G`, the image `f(s(x))` is equal to the composition of `f(x)` and the group inverse `Inv(G,f)(s(x))`. Writing this in a more natural language:\n\nA homeomorphism `f` from group `G` to itself, via substitution `s`, is defined as: for all elements `x` in `G`, `f(s(x))` equals the composition of `f(x)` and the group inverse of `s(x)` under `G`.", "statement": "definition\n  \"HomDiff(G,f,s,x) \\<equiv> \n  f`\\<langle>s`(f`\\<langle> fst(x),snd(x)\\<rangle>) , \n  (GroupInv(G,f)`(f`\\<langle> s`(fst(x)),s`(snd(x))\\<rangle>))\\<rangle>\"\n"}
