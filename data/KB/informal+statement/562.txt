{"informal": " In the group1 theory, if x is an element of the Cartesian product G \u00d7 G (denoted by x \u2208 G \u00d7 G), then the identity element (id(G)) and x form a pair under the delta relation, which is the symmetric equivalence relation defining the group operation, implying that they are equal to the group identity element and thus the product of identity and x equals x itself. Therefore, \\<delta>(id(G), x) = \\<one> (where \\<one> represents the identity or unit element).", "statement": "lemma (in group1) Group_ZF_3_4_L14: assumes A1: \"x \\<in> G\\<times>G\"\n  shows \"\\<delta>(id(G),x) = \\<one>\"\n"}
