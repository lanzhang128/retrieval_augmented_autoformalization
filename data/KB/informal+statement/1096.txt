{"informal": " The set-theoretic concept of supremum for a real number r and a non-empty set A is defined as the least elementminimum in the set of upper boundsintersect A with the set ofelements a in A such that r is less than or equal to r intersected with a. In other words, the supremum of r with respect to A is the smallest upper bound of r with respect to the elements in A.", "statement": "definition\n  \"Supremum(r,A) \\<equiv> Minimum(r,\\<Inter>a\\<in>A. r``{a})\"\n"}
