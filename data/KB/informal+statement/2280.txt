{"informal": " If the relation `r` is symmetric (i.e., `r` is equal to its converse), then the image of `r` under the squared relation `r` equals the set of all pairs `(x, y)` such that `x` and `y` are related by `r`. \n\nThis can be expressed in a brief natural language statement as:\n\nFor any relation `r`, if `r` is symmetric (i.e., `r` is equal to its converse), then `r \u00d7 r` equals the set of all pairs `(x, y)` such that `x` is related to `y` via `r`.\n\nOr, even more briefly:\n\nIf `r` is symmetric, then `r \u00d7 r` = {(x, y). x \u0420--- y}.", "statement": "lemma symm_sq_prod_image: assumes \"converse(r) = r\" \n  shows \"r O r = \\<Union>{(r``{x})\\<times>(r``{x}). x \\<in> domain(r)}\"\n"}
