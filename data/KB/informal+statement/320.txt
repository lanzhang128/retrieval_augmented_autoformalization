{"informal": " If function r is total on X, transitive, and X is finite (A1, A2, A3), and set A is either empty or has a maximum element under relation r (A5), then A union {x}, the set of all elements in A plus the element x, is either empty or has a maximum element under relation r. (Note: In ZF set theory, the concept of finiteness is often formulated using cardinality, but the code seems to be using the assumption A3: \"A <in> Fin(X)\" as a way to represent that A is finite in the context of the given X.)", "statement": "lemma Finite_ZF_1_1_L1: \n  assumes A1: \"r {is total on} X\" and A2: \"trans(r)\"\n  and A3: \"A\\<in>Fin(X)\" and A4: \"x\\<in>X\" and A5: \"A=0 \\<or> HasAmaximum(r,A)\"\n  shows \"A\\<union>{x} = 0 \\<or> HasAmaximum(r,A\\<union>{x})\"\n"}
