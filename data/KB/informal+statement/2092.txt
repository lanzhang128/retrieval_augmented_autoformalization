{"informal": " If a set T is a subset of another set X, then the restricted IncludedSet relation (which maps a set to the elements of another set that belong to it) of X with respect to a third set Y is equal to the IncludedSet relation of the intersection of Y and X with respect to Y intersected with T.", "statement": "lemma subspace_includedset:\n  assumes \"T\\<subseteq>X\"\n  shows \"IncludedSet(X,T) {restricted to} Y = IncludedSet(Y\\<inter>X,Y\\<inter>T)\"\n"}
