{"informal": " A \"TopologyWithBase\" is defined as a set T satisfying the following condition: if a set U fulfills the base condition (i.e., belongs to the TopologyBase, which has a size of 50), then Set U is the base for Topology T. In other words, the base sets of Topology T are exactly the sets from TopologyBase that fulfill the base condition.", "statement": "definition \n  TopologyWithBase (\"TopologyBase _ \" 50) where\n  \"U {satisfies the base condition} \\<Longrightarrow> TopologyBase U \\<equiv> THE T.
