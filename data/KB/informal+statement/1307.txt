{"informal": " In the group3 theory, if r is a total function on G, then AbsoluteValue(G, P, r), which is a function from G to the power set of G, is a subset of G ->+, the set of all functions from G to G that are positive, i.e., map every element to a non-empty set.\n\nIn simpler terms, given a group G and a total function r from G to itself, the domain of AbsoluteValue(G, P, r), which is the set of pairs (g, h) such that g is in the image of r from some element p in G, forms a set under the function addition, hence it's a sub-semigroup of the group of all functions from G to G.", "statement": "lemma (in group3) OrderedGroup_ZF_3_L3C:\n  assumes A1: \"r {is total on} G\"\n  shows \"AbsoluteValue(G,P,r) : G\\<rightarrow>G\\<^sup>+\"\n"}
