{"informal": " In the theory of NonDetFinStateAuto (non-determistic finite state automata), the LanguageNFSA is a regular language if and only if its alphabet is finite. This is stated as a corollary called lang_is_regular. The proof is done using the definition of a regular language and the rules of existence for powersets, the empty set, and a certain subset of states. In simple terms, this corollary states that a language accepted by a non-deterministic finite state automaton is a regular language if and only if its alphabet is finite.", "statement": "corollary (in NonDetFinStateAuto) lang_is_regular:\n  shows \"LanguageNFSA{is a regular language on}\\<Sigma>\"\n  unfolding IsRegularLanguage_def[OF finite_alphabet]\n  apply (rule exI[of _ \"Pow(S)\"],\n         rule exI[of _ \"{s\\<^sub>0}\"],\n         rule exI[of _ tPow],\n         rule exI[of _ \"{Q \\<in> Pow(S).
