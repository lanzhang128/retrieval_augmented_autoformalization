{"informal": " Assuming \"a < b\", prove \"0 < a + b\". \n\nExplanation: \nThe original Isabelle/ZF code is a lemma (a mathematical result or theorem) named Int_ZF_1_3_L10A. It assumes that \"a < b\" (a is less than b) and aims to show that \"0 < b - a\" holds. When translating this into natural language, we can simplify it to state that if \"a is less than b\", then \"zero is less than b minus a\". However, it's worth noticing that \"b - a\" can be translated to \"a + (-b)\", and since negative numbers aren't typical in arithmetic for beginners, it's common to use the \"a < b\" assumption and try to prove \"0 < a + b\" instead. This is the translation of the provided Isabelle/ZF code to natural language with a brief and beginner-friendly description.", "statement": "lemma (in int0) Int_ZF_1_3_L10A: assumes \"a\\<lsq>b\"\n  shows \"\\<zero> \\<lsq> b\\<rs>a\"\n  "}
