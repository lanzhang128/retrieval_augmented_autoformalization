{"informal": " The definition \"Tail(a)\" asserts equivalence to the set of pairs {<k, a(k+1)> | k is in the predicate of the domain of a}. In English, this could be stated as:\n\n\"The tail of a relation a is the set of pairs {<k, v> | k is an index in the domain of a and v is the successor image of k under a}.\"\n\nor more succinctly:\n\n\"Tail(a) = {<k, v> | k in pred(domain(a)), v = a(succ(k))}\"", "statement": "definition  \n  \"Tail(a) \\<equiv> {\\<langle>k, a`(succ(k))\\<rangle>. k \\<in> pred(domain(a))}\"\n"}
