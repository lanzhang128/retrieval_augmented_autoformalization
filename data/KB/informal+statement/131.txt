{"informal": " A field K with addition operator A and multiplication operator M is an subfield of another field K' with addition operator A' and multiplication operator M' if and only if:\n\n1. K with A and M is a ring (i.e., it is an algebraic structure with addition and multiplication).\n2. M is commutative with respect to K (i.e., for all a, b in K, M(a, b) = M(b, a)).\n3. K has a non-zero neutral element for addition, but this element is different from the neutral element of M (i.e., there exists an element in K that is not the additive identity for K but maps to the additive identity of M under the multiplication M).\n4. For any a in K, there exists a b in K such that the product M(a, b) equals the neutral element of M.", "statement": "definition\n  \"IsAfield(K,A,M) \\<equiv> \n  (IsAring(K,A,M) \\<and> (M {is commutative on} K) \\<and>\n  TheNeutralElement(K,A) \\<noteq> TheNeutralElement(K,M) \\<and> \n  (\\<forall>a\\<in>K. a\\<noteq>TheNeutralElement(K,A)\\<longrightarrow>\n  (\\<exists>b\\<in>K.
