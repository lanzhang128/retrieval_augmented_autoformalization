{"informal": " Assuming function f: int -> int and the absolute difference between its values at any two integers a, b is less than or equal to real number L, and integers m and n both belong to the set of integers with positive and negative indices, respectively: \n\nIt holds that the absolute difference between f(0) and f(m) plus the absolute difference between f(0) and f(n) is less than or equal to 2 * L. \n\nAlternatively, in a more colloquial manner: \n\nGiven a function f mapping integers to integers with the property that the absolute difference between its values at any two integers is less than or equal to a fixed real number L.
