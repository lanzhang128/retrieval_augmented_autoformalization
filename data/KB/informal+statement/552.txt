{"informal": " In the group1 theory, we have the following facts:\n\n1. The subset AH of our group G is closed under composition. In other words, for all x, y in AH, the result of composing x and y, x \u2218 y, is also an element of AH.\n2. The binary operation AlHomOp2(G, P), which represents the left homomorphism of the binary operation P with respect to G, is associative on the subset AH. This means that for all x, y, z in AH, applying the binary operation P twice in any order results in the same outcome: (x \u2218 y) \u2218 z = x \u2218 (y \u2218 z).", "statement": "lemma (in group1) Group_ZF_3_4_L6: shows \n  \"AH {is closed under} Composition(G)\"\n  \"AlHomOp2(G,P) {is associative on} AH\"\n"}
