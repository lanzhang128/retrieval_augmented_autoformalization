{"informal": " The RealNumbers type is defined to be equivalent to the quotient space Slopes / SlopeEquivalenceRel. \n\nThis means that two slopes are considered equal in RealNumbers if and only if their equivalence classes under SlopeEquivalenceRel are the same. Essentially, this code defines the RealNumbers type as a set of equivalence classes of slopes.", "statement": "definition\n  \"RealNumbers \\<equiv> Slopes//SlopeEquivalenceRel\"\n"}
