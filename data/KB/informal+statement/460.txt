{"informal": " In the group0 theory, given sets A and B that are subsets of a group G, the image of their union under the function P (assuming it is a function defined on subsets of G), is equal to the left translation of set B by every element in A, with respect to P and the group G. In other words, the image of the union of two sets under P is the set obtained by translating each element of the second set by every element in the first set using the left translation operation defined in the group.", "statement": "lemma (in group0) image_ltrans_union: assumes \"A\\<subseteq>G\" \"B\\<subseteq>G\" shows\n  \"(P {lifted to subsets of} G)`\\<langle>A,B\\<rangle> = (\\<Union>a\\<in>A.
