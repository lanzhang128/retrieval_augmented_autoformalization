{"informal": " Given a binary relation R such that A is an order, then:\n\n1. R is an irreflexive relation (no element is related to itself).\n2. Transitivity holds for R (if A is related to B, and B is related to C, then A is related to C).\n3. A is a partial order (every non-empty subset has a least element).\n4. Linear order holds for A (there are no cycles in the relation).\n5. Total order property for A (every two distinct elements have a least upper bound).", "statement": "lemma orders_imp_tot_ord: assumes A1: \"R Orders A\"\n  shows \n  \"irrefl(A,R)\"\n  \"trans[A](R)\"\n  \"part_ord(A,R)\"\n  \"linear(A,R)\"\n  \"tot_ord(A,R)\"\n"}
