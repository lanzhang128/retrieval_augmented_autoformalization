{"informal": " If the relation r is an equivalence relation on the union T, then the product of T/r and the quotient space t(T/r) with respect to the quotient topology is a continuous function. \n\nHere, T/r denotes the quotient set of T with respect to the equivalence relation r, and t(T/r) is the quotient topology on T/r induced by the original topology t on T. The notation \u27e8b, c\u27e9 represents the equivalence class containing the pair (b, c) under the equivalence relation r.
