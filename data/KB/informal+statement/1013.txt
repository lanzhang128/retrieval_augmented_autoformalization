{"informal": " In the monoid0 theory, the neutral element (denoted by \"e\") is assumed to be defined as TheNeutralElement of the group G and operation f. The lemma asserts that e is an element of G (belongs to G), and for all g in G, the operation of adding e to g (denoted by oplus) results in g on both sides, i.e., g and g with e added are equal. In other words, the neutral element e is an identity element for the group.", "statement": "lemma (in monoid0) unit_is_neutral:\n  assumes A1: \"e = TheNeutralElement(G,f)\"\n  shows \"e \\<in> G \\<and> (\\<forall>g\\<in>G. e \\<oplus> g = g \\<and> g \\<oplus> e = g)\"\n"}
