{"informal": " Given a uniformity Phi on X, a relation R subset of X times X, an element W belonging to Phi and being the converse of itself, J is defined as the uniform topology generated by Phi over X. It is shown that the closure of R under J (the relation generated by taking arbitrary unions of finite intersections of sets in J) is included in W union (the set-theoretic intersection of R and W).", "statement": "lemma utop3cls: \n  assumes \"\\<Phi> {is a uniformity on} X\" \"R\\<subseteq>X\\<times>X\" \"W\\<in>\\<Phi>\" \"W=converse(W)\"\n  defines \"J \\<equiv> UniformTopology(\\<Phi>,X)\"\n  shows \"Closure(R,J\\<times>\\<^sub>tJ) \\<subseteq> W O (R O W)\"\n"}
