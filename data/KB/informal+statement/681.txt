{"informal": " In the int0 theory, prove that the integers form an ordered ring with respect to addition, multiplication, and the integer order. In other words, show that <int, IntegerAddition, IntegerMultiplication, IntegerOrder> is an ordered ring. This can be stated as:\n\nTheoretically, integers (<int>) constitute an ordered ring when equipped with integer addition (IntegerAddition), integer multiplication (IntegerMultiplication), and the integer order (IntegerOrder).", "statement": "theorem (in int0) Int_ZF_1_3_T1: shows \n  \"IsAnOrdRing(\\<int>,IntegerAddition,IntegerMultiplication,IntegerOrder)\"\n  \"ring1(\\<int>,IntegerAddition,IntegerMultiplication,IntegerOrder)\"\n  "}
