{"informal": " Given an infinite set Q, it can be written as the natural numbers or as a set with a successor element j having an infinite subset. In symbols, this can be expressed as Q = \u2115 \u2228 \u2203j. (csucc(j) < Q \u2227 InfCard j), where InfCard represents the property of being an infinite set, csucc is the successor function, and \u2228 represents the logical disjunction. This statement asserts that any infinite set Q has these two possible representations.", "statement": "lemma InfCard_cases_disj:\n  assumes \"InfCard(Q)\"\n  shows \"Q=nat \\<or> (\\<exists>j. csucc(j)\\<lesssim>Q \\<and> InfCard(j))\"\n"}
