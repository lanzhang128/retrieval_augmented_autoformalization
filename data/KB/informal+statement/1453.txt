{"informal": " A binary relation \"LeftDiv\" on a set G and a element A is defined as the set of all pairs p in G x G such that there exists z in G with p's first component divided by z equals A's first component and p is in the Cartesian product of G and G.", "statement": "definition\n  \"LeftDiv(G,A) \\<equiv> {\\<langle>p,\\<Union>{z\\<in>G.
