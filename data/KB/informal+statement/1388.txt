{"informal": " In the ring1 theory, if a and b are in the ring, and a is not less than b, then b is greater than a, and their negations are inverse order. In other words, if a and b are in the ring and a is not smaller than b, then b is larger than a, and the negation of a is smaller than the negation of b. Furthermore, a is not equal to b.", "statement": "lemma (in ring1) OrdRing_ZF_1_L4A: assumes A1: \"a\\<in>R\"  \"b\\<in>R\"\n  and A2: \"\\<not>(a\\<lsq>b)\"\n  shows \"b \\<lsq> a\"  \"(\\<rm>a) \\<lsq> (\\<rm>b)\"  \"a\\<noteq>b\"\n"}
