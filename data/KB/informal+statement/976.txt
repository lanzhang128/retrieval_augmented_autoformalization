{"informal": " In the theory `complex0`, we have a lemma `MMIsar_valid` stating that the function `MMIsar0` is valid when applied to real and complex numbers `R`, `A`, with `R` being non-zero, `A` being any complex number, `i` being the imaginary unit, and `M` being a real multiplier, as well as `CplxAdd(R,A)`, `CplxMul(R,A,M)`, and `StrictVersion(CplxROrder(R,A,r))`. This means that the function `MMIsar0` correctly processes these inputs according to the defined rules in Isabelle/ZF.", "statement": "lemma (in complex0) MMIsar_valid: \n  shows \"MMIsar0(\\<real>,\\<complex>,\\<one>,\\<zero>,\\<i>,CplxAdd(R,A),CplxMul(R,A,M),\n  StrictVersion(CplxROrder(R,A,r)))\"\n"}
