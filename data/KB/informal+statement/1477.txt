{"informal": " Assuming that `a, b, c, d` are real numbers, show that `a * b = c * d` if and only if `a * b + 0 = c * d + 0`, i.e., `a * b = c * d` is equivalent to `(a * b) + 0 = (c * d) + 0`, where `*` represents real multiplication and `+ 0` represents adding zero to both sides. This statement can be also represented as `(a * b = c * d) <=> (a * b + 0 = c * d + 0)` in Isabelle/ZF.", "statement": "lemma (in real0) Real_ZF_1_L7A: \n  assumes \"a\\<in>\\<real>\"  \"b\\<in>\\<real>\"  \"c\\<in>\\<real>\"  \"d\\<in>\\<real>\"\n  shows \"a\\<rs>b \\<ra> (c\\<rs>d) = a\\<ra>c\\<rs>b\\<rs>d\"\n  "}
