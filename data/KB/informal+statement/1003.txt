{"informal": " In the context of `pmetric_space1`, it can be shown that the quadruple `<real, Add, ROrd, d, X>` forms a metric space, where `real` is the set of reals, `Add` is the plus operation, `ROrd` is the minimum operation, `d` is a function defining the distance, and `X` is an arbitrary point. This is done by unfolding the definitions of `pmetric_space` and its axioms, and the definition of `loop1_def`.", "statement": "lemma (in pmetric_space1) pmetric_space_pmetric_space1_valid: \n  shows \"pmetric_space(\\<real>,Add,ROrd,\\<d>,X)\"\n  unfolding pmetric_space_def pmetric_space_axioms_def loop1_def\n  "}
