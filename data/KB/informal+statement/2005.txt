{"informal": " If hereditary property P holds for a topology T, then T is anti-anti-property-of-P.\n\nHere's a more detailed natural language version:\n\nAssume that the property P is hereditary in the topology T, and that T satisfies property P. Then T has the anti-property with respect to property P. \n\nIn other words, any subspace of T that satisfies property P must also satisfy the property that is the negation of the anti-property of P.", "statement": "theorem (in topology0)her_P_imp_anti2P:\n  assumes \"P{is hereditary}\" \"P(T)\"\n  shows \"T{is anti-}ANTI(P)\"\n"}
