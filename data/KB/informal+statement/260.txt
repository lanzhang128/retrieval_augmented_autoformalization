{"informal": " In the context of Deterministic Finite State Automata (DetFinStateAuto), the following lemma (named `seq_is_restriction`) asserts that if a transition from state `w` to state `u` is in the transitive closure of the relation `r_D`, then the restriction of `u` to the domain of `w` is equal to `u`. This can be expressed in natural language as:\n\nIf there exists a sequence of states and transitions from `w` to `u` such that each transition is in the transitive closure of `r_D`, then the restriction of `u` to the domain of `w` is equivalent to `u`.", "statement": "lemma (in DetFinStateAuto) seq_is_restriction:\n  fixes w s u v\n  assumes \"\\<langle>\\<langle>w,s\\<rangle>,\\<langle>u,v\\<rangle>\\<rangle>\\<in>r\\<^sub>D^*\"\n  shows \"restrict(w,domain(u)) = u\"\n"}
