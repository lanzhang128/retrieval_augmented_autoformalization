{"informal": " In the theory `complex0`, there is a lemma named `axaddopr` which states that the operation `CplxAdd` (which takes two complex numbers as arguments) results in a complex number. In other words, `CplxAdd` is a function from the Cartesian product of the complex number type to the complex number type.", "statement": "lemma (in complex0) axaddopr: shows \"CplxAdd(R,A): \\<complex> \\<times> \\<complex> \\<rightarrow> \\<complex>\"\n"}
