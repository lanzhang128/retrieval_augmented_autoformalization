{"informal": " If X is a linearly ordered set with respect to relation r, and P is a property that holds for the empty set and such that for every finite subset A of X, if A is non-empty then P holds for A if it holds for A excluding its maximum element, then property P holds for any finite subset B of X.", "statement": "lemma fin_ord_induction:  \n  assumes A1: \"IsLinOrder(X,r)\" and A2: \"P(0)\" and\n  A3: \"\\<forall>A \\<in> FinPow(X).
