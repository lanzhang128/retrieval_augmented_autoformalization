{"informal": " Assuming X is not a subset of natural numbers, then CoFinite X is hyperconnected. \n\nHere, CoFinite X refers to the set of all cofinite subsets of X. A subset is cofinite if its complement has a finite number of elements. Hyperconnected is a graph theoretic concept where every node can be reached from every other node through a finite sequence of edges. In this context, the lemma states that the graph of cofinite subsets of X, under inclusion, is hyperconnected.", "statement": "lemma Cofinite_nat_HConn:\n  assumes \"\\<not>(X\\<prec>nat)\"\n  shows \"(CoFinite X){is hyperconnected}\"\n"}
