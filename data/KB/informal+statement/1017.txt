{"informal": " Assuming that `e` is an element of a group `G` such that the identity `e` is absorbed and distributed over every element `g` in `G`, then `e` is the neutral element of `G`.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of the code:\n\n1. The `lemma` statement declares a new theorem named `group0_1_L4`.\n2. The `in monoid0` statement indicates that the theorem belongs to the context of the monoid typeclass.\n3. The assumptions `A1` state that `e` is an element of `G` and that `e` is an identity element, which absorbs and distributes over every element `g` in `G`.\n4. The `shows` section attempts to prove that `e` is the neutral element of the group (denoted by `TheNeutralElement(G,f)` in this code snippet) using the given assumptions.", "statement": "lemma (in monoid0) group0_1_L4: \n  assumes A1: \"e \\<in> G \\<and> (\\<forall>g\\<in>G. e \\<oplus> g = g \\<and> g \\<oplus> e = g)\"\n  shows \"e = TheNeutralElement(G,f)\"\n"}
