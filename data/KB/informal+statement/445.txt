{"informal": " In the group0 theory, given that g is an element of the group G, prove that RightTranslation(G, P, g) and LeftTranslation(G, P, g) are both functions from G to G.\n\nHere's a more detailed natural language version:\n\nAssume that g is an element in the group G (as specified by the hypothesis A1 in the Isabelle code). Prove that for any group operation P and group G, there are two functions:\n1. RightTranslation(G,P,g): a function that takes any element x in G and returns the result of applying right translation by g using the specified group operation P.\n2. LeftTranslation(G,P,g): a function that takes any element x in G and returns the result of applying left translation by g using the specified group operation P.\n\nBoth of these functions return elements within the group G. Therefore, they are functions from G to G.", "statement": "lemma (in group0) group0_5_L1: assumes A1: \"g\\<in>G\"\n  shows \"RightTranslation(G,P,g) : G\\<rightarrow>G\" and  \"LeftTranslation(G,P,g) : G\\<rightarrow>G\"\n"}
