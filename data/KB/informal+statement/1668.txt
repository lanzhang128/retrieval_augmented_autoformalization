{"informal": " A set I is finitely generated in the context of the ring R if and only if there exists a finite subset S of R such that I is the powerset generated by S, denoted as <I>=<^sub>S. In other words, every element in I can be expressed as a finite combination of elements from the finite subset S using the ring operations.", "statement": "definition (in ring0) isFinGen (\"_{is finitely generated}\") where\n\"I\\<triangleleft>R \\<Longrightarrow> I{is finitely generated} \\<equiv> \\<exists>S\\<in>FinPow(R).
