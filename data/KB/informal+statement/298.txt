{"informal": " The lemma `finpow_union_card_nat` asserts that the finite power set `FinPow(X)` of a set `X` equals the set of subsets of `X` with cardinality less than or equal to natural numbers, i.e., `{A \u2286 Pow(X) | card A \u2264 n}`, where `n` ranges over natural numbers. In more familiar terms, it states that the finite power set `FinPow(X)` is equal to the union of all sets `A` Subset of the power set `Pow(X)` with cardinality less than or equal to natural numbers.", "statement": "lemma finpow_union_card_nat: \n  shows \"FinPow(X) = (\\<Union>n \\<in> nat. {A \\<in> Pow(X).
