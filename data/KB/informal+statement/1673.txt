{"informal": " In the ring2 context, the function f \\circ I is a surjection from R to R \\circ I. Here, I denotes the ideal generator, and \"surjection\" implies the property of being onto or having the inverse image of every subset being non-empty. Hence, for every element in R\\circ I, there exists some element in R such that their image under f \\circ I is equal to that element in R\\circ I. The definition of quotient function qfun is used to derive this statement.", "statement": "lemma (in ring2) quot_fun:\n  shows \"f\\<^sub>I\\<in>surj(R,R\\<^sub>I)\" unfolding qfun_def "}
