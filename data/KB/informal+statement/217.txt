{"informal": " Given a natural number `n` and a relation `a` such that the successor of `n` is in the domain of `a`, which holds `X` for each successor of a natural number, the tail of `a` is a relation over `n` that equals `a` for the first `n + 1` elements, and holds `X` for the rest of the elements.\n\nOr,\n\nIf `n` is a natural number and `a` is a relation whose domain includes the successor of `n`, such that `a` holds `X` for every successor of a natural number, then the tail of `a`, denoted as `Tail(a)`, is a relation over `n` that matches `a` for the first `n + 1` elements and `X` for all the remaining elements.", "statement": "theorem tail_props: \n  assumes A1: \"n \\<in> nat\" and A2: \"a: succ(n) \\<rightarrow> X\"\n  shows\n  \"Tail(a) : n \\<rightarrow> X\"\n  \"\\<forall>k \\<in> n.
