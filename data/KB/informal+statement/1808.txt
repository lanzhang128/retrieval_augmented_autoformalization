{"informal": " In the topology0 theory, given a set V that is an element of the topology T, there exists for every x in V a set U in T such that x is an element of U and U is a subset of V. In other words, for any set V in the topology T, each point x in V has an open neighborhood U in V itself.", "statement": "lemma (in topology0) open_open_neigh: \n  assumes A1: \"V\\<in>T\" \n  shows \"\\<forall>x\\<in>V. \\<exists>U\\<in>T.
