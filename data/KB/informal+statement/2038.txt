{"informal": " This statement defines a lemma called \"quotient_proj_fun\" in Isabelle/ZF. The lemma states that the projection function of a quotient space is a function from the base space A to itself, with domain A and range A//r, where r is the equivalence relation. The function is defined as the projection of the image of an element b in A under the equivalence relation r, which maps b to its equivalence class representative [b]. The statement is proved using standard definitions and constructions in Isabelle/ZF, and the proof is automated. In natural language, the statement can be briefed as:\n\nLemma quotient_proj_fun: The projection function from A to A//r is a function from A to A.", "statement": "lemma quotient_proj_fun:\n  shows \"{\\<langle>b,r``{b}\\<rangle>. b\\<in>A}:A\\<rightarrow>A//r\" unfolding Pi_def function_def domain_def\n    unfolding quotient_def by auto\n"}
