{"informal": " Given an integer `k` and integers `m` and `n` such that `m` is less than `n`, it follows that the integer `k` is less than the integer `m` in the reverse order, and that the integer `m` is less than the integer `n` in the reverse order, which implies that `k` is less than `n` in the reverse order as well.\n\nIn other words, if `m < n` and `k` is an integer, then `k < m < n` is equivalent to `m < k < n` (or `k < m < n` in reverse order).", "statement": "lemma (in int0) int_ord_transl_inv: \n  assumes A1: \"k \\<in> \\<int>\" and A2: \"m \\<lsq> n\" \n  shows \"m\\<ra>k \\<lsq> n\\<ra>k \"  \"k\\<ra>m\\<lsq> k\\<ra>n \"\n"}
