{"informal": " Assuming that `n` and `k` are natural numbers, the lemma states that:\n\n- `n < k` if and only if `n` comes before `k` in the natural number line.\n- `n` comes before `k` in the natural number line if and only if `n` is smaller than `k` and `1` is between them.\n\nTherefore, the lemma tells us that the relations `<` (less than), `<` (comes before), and the inclusion relation `<:` (is strictly smaller than and has no intervening numbers) are equivalent. In other words, `n < k` if and only if both `n <:` `k` and `n < k`.", "statement": "lemma (in complex0) no_nats_between: \n  assumes A1: \"n \\<in> \\<nat>\"  \"k \\<in> \\<nat>\"\n  shows \n  \"n\\<lsq>k \\<longleftrightarrow> n \\<ls> k\\<ca>\\<one>\"\n  \"n \\<ls> k \\<longleftrightarrow> n \\<ca> \\<one> \\<lsq> k\" \n"}
