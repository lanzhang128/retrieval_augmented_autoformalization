{"informal": " Given natural number n, element x in X, function F from n to X that maps each natural number to an element in X, and the inductive sequence variable a of length succ(n) that is defined using InductiveSeqVarFN with base element x, X, function F, and index n, then the following properties hold:\n\n1. a is a sequence of length succ(n) over X.\n2. The first element in the sequence a is equal to the base element x.\n3. For all k in n (from 0 up to n), the successor element in the sequence a, indexed by succ(k), is equal to the application of F to the index k and the corresponding element in the sequence a at index k. In other words, a(succ(k)) = F(k)(a(k)).", "statement": "theorem fin_indseq_var_f_props: \n  assumes A1: \"n \\<in> nat\" and A2: \"x\\<in>X\" and A3: \"F: n \\<rightarrow> (X\\<rightarrow>X)\" and \n  A4: \"a = InductiveSeqVarFN(x,X,F,n)\"\n  shows\n  \"a: succ(n) \\<rightarrow> X\"\n  \"a`(0) = x\"\n  \"\\<forall>k\\<in>n. a`(succ(k)) = F`(k)`(a`(k))\"\n"}
