{"informal": " Given a function f from integers to integers and integers m and n, the HomDiff function, which computes the difference between functions in the category of integer addition, equals the delta function, which measures the difference between the values of f for m and n. In ZF set theory, this is expressed as:\n\nIf f is a function from integers to integers, and m and n are integers, then HomDiff(IntegerAddition, f, \u27e8m, n\u27e9) = \u03b4(f, m, n).", "statement": "lemma (in int1) Int_ZF_2_1_L3: \n  assumes \"f:\\<int>\\<rightarrow>\\<int>\" and \"m\\<in>\\<int>\"  \"n\\<in>\\<int>\"\n  shows \"HomDiff(\\<int>,IntegerAddition,f,\\<langle> m,n\\<rangle>) = \\<delta>(f,m,n)\"\n  "}
