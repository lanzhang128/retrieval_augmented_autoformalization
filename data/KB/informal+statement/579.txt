{"informal": " In Isabelle/ZF, the given theorem `Lagrange` states that the order of a group `G` is equal to the product of the orders of a subgroup `H` and the quotient group `G / r`, where `r` is the equivalence relation of the quotient group of `G` by `H`.\n\nHere's a natural language translation with some brief explanations of the key concepts:\n\nWithin group `G`, assume:\n1. The group is finite, in other words, it has a finite number of elements.\n2. Subgroup `H` is a subgroup of `G` under operation `P`.\n\nDefine `r` as the equivalence relation corresponding to the quotient group of `G` by `H`.\n\nShow that the order of `G` equals the product of the order of `H` and the order of the quotient group `G / r`.\n\nProof:\n\nFirst, establish that `r` is indeed an equivalence relation:\n\n1. Reflexivity: For every `g in G`, `g r g`, or equivalently, `g \u2261 g` is true.\n2. Symmetry: If `g r h` holds, then `h r g` also holds.\n3. Transitivity: If `g r h` and `h r i` are true, then `g r i` also holds.\n\nWith this foundation, use the theorem \"order of a group equals the product of the orders of a subgroup and a quotient group\".\n\nIn natural language terms, this theorem says that the total number of distinct elements in group `G` equals the number of elements in subgroup `H` multiplied by the number of distinct equivalence classes in the quotient group `G / r`.", "statement": "theorem (in group0) Lagrange:\n  assumes \"Finite(G)\" \"IsAsubgroup(H,P)\"\n  defines \"r \\<equiv> QuotientGroupRel(G,P,H)\"\n  shows \"|G|=|H| #* |G//r|\"\nproof-\n  have equiv:\"equiv(G,r)\" "}
