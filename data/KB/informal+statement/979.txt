{"informal": " Assuming x is a real number, x is in the set of real numbers if and only if x is a finite real number.\n\nExplanation: \n\nThe lemma \"xrrebndt\" is defined in the context \"complex0\" and states that under assumption \"A1\" which ensures x is a real number, x is in the set of real numbers if and only if x is a finite real number. The set of finite real numbers is denoted as \"real^\" which represents the set of real numbers excluding infinity and negative infinity. \n\nUsing Isabelle/ZF, the code checks that the input term \"x\" is an element of the set \"real^\" by assumption \"A1\", then uses the logical equivalence to show that this set can be defined as the intersection of real numbers with finite numbers using set builders operator and the logical negation operator. This can be read as in natural language as the statement above.", "statement": "lemma (in complex0) xrrebndt: assumes A1: \"x \\<in> \\<real>\\<^sup>*\"\n  shows \"x \\<in> \\<real> \\<longleftrightarrow> ( \\<cmnf> \\<ls> x \\<and> x \\<ls> \\<cpnf> )\"\n"}
