{"informal": " In the group0 theory, if F is a function from X to P, H is a subgroup of F, and g is the restriction of F to H times H, then for any s in H, the inverse of s under H using g is equal to the inverse of s under the group P using F. Note that \"IsAsubgroup(H,F)\" and \"restrict(F,H\\<times>H)\" are commonly expressed in natural language as \"H is a subgroup of F\" and \"g is the restriction of F to H x H,\" respectively.", "statement": "lemma (in group0) Group_ZF_2_1_L6A:\n  assumes A1: \"F = P {lifted to function space over} X\"\n  and A2: \"IsAsubgroup(H,F)\"\n  and A3: \"g = restrict(F,H\\<times>H)\"\n  and A4: \"s\\<in>H\"\n  shows \"GroupInv(H,g)`(s) = GroupInv(G,P) O s\"\n"}
