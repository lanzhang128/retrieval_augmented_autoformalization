{"informal": " The lemma asserts that the set of real numbers equipped with the addition operation forms both a commutative group (without identity element) in ZF set theory. In other words, real numbers form a commutative group under addition, where the commutative property holds for any two real numbers:\n\nThe set of real numbers {RealNumbers} forms a commutative group under addition (RealAddition) with respect to the following properties:\n1. The binary operation RealAddition is associative over the set RealNumbers.\n2. The commutative property holds for RealAddition, i.e., a + b = b + a for all real numbers a and b.\n3. The group has no identity element, because the ZF constant \"group0\" only applies to sets equipped with an additive identity.\n\nThus, we can briefly state the lemma in natural language as follows:\n\nThe real numbers, without an additive identity, form a commutative group under addition. Addition of real numbers satisfies the commutative property, i.e., a + b = b + a for all real numbers a and b.", "statement": "lemma Real_ZF_1_L2: shows\n  \"group0(RealNumbers,RealAddition)\"\n  \"RealAddition {is commutative on} RealNumbers\"\n  \"group1(RealNumbers,RealAddition)\"\n"}
