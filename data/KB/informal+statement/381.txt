{"informal": " In general, the statement \"zf_embed_move\" asserts that the embedding function \"embed\" for ZF set theory preserves the move operation \"O\" on sets, and the result is the identity function on small sets. In other words, moving a set using the embedding function is equivalent to leaving it unchanged for small sets.", "statement": "theorem (in generalization) zf_embed_move: shows \"zf_move O embed = id(small)\"\n"}
