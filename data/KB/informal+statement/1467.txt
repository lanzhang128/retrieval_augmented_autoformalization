{"informal": " \"RealAddition is defined as the equivalence relation given by Slopes and SlopeEquivalenceRel, based on the operation SlopeOp1.\"\n\nThis statement means that RealAddition is an equivalence relation on some collection of slopes, defined using the binary relation SlopeEquivalenceRel and the slope operation SlopeOp1. The use of ProjFun2 indicates that Slopes is a pair (a function or relation with two components), likely representing the first and second components of the slope vectors to be compared.", "statement": "definition\n  \"RealAddition \\<equiv> ProjFun2(Slopes,SlopeEquivalenceRel,SlopeOp1)\"\n"}
