{"informal": " The lemma `setproddef` in `semigr1` asserts that the function application `(\\<Lambda>, a)` equals the product `(a O \\<sigma>(<Lambda>))` in set theory. Here is a natural language version of this statement:\n\nFor all sets `A` and all elements `a` in `A`, the set function application `<Lambda>` applied to the element `a`, i.e., `<Lambda>(a)`, is equal to the product of `a` and the image of `<Lambda>` under the operation `O` (i.e., the set difference). In other words, `<Lambda>{a} = a \\<setdiff>\\<sigma>(<Lambda>)`.", "statement": "lemma (in semigr1) setproddef: \n  shows \"\\<pr>(\\<Lambda>,a) = \\<Prod> (a O \\<sigma>(\\<Lambda>))\"\n  "}
