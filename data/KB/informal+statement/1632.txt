{"informal": " In the ring0 theory, if a, b, and c are elements of the ring R, then the product of a, the product of b and c, and the product of a and the product of b and c, are equal. In other words, the associative property holds for the multiplication operation in ring R.\n\nFurthermore, the same holds true for the use of the infix notation \"ra\" for multiplication, and \".\" for the same multiplication operation, interchangeably. Hence, a \"ra\" b \"ra\" c equals a \"(ra\" b) c and a \".\" b \".\" c equals a \"(.\" b \".)\" c.", "statement": "lemma (in ring0) Ring_ZF_1_L11: \n  assumes \"a\\<in>R\"  \"b\\<in>R\"  \"c\\<in>R\"\n  shows \n  \"a\\<ra>b\\<ra>c = a\\<ra>(b\\<ra>c)\"\n  \"a\\<cdot>b\\<cdot>c = a\\<cdot>(b\\<cdot>c)\"\n  "}
