{"informal": " If functions g : A -> B and f : C -> D have domains A and C, respectively, with B being a subset of C, then their composition f o g is a function from A to D.", "statement": "lemma comp_fun_subset: \n  assumes A1: \"g:A\\<rightarrow>B\"  and A2: \"f:C\\<rightarrow>D\" and A3: \"B \\<subseteq> C\"\n  shows \"f O g : A \\<rightarrow> D\"\n"}
