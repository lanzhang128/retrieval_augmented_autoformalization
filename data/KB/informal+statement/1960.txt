{"informal": " Given a filter `F` on a union of sets `uu`, and an element `x` in `uu`, we have that `x` belongs to the filter `F`.\n\nMore formally, the Isabelle/ZF lemma states that for any filter `F` on the union of sets `uu`, and for every element `x` in `uu`, we have `x \u2208 F \u2192 x \u2208 (F \u22c3 {0})`. This means that if an element `x` is in the filter `F`, then it is also in the union of the filter `F` and the empty set `{0}`.\n\nIn simpler terms, if an element `x` is in a filter `F` on a union of sets `uu`, then it is still in the union of that filter and the empty set. This is equivalent to saying that the filter `F` is contained in the larger filter generated by `F \u222a {0}` on `uu`.", "statement": "lemma lim_filter_top_of_filter:\n  assumes \"\\<FF> {is a filter on} \\<Union>\\<FF>\" and \"x\\<in>\\<Union>\\<FF>\"\n  shows \"\\<FF> \\<rightarrow>\\<^sub>F x {in} (\\<FF>\\<union>{0})\"\n"}
