{"informal": " In the real number theory theory `real1`, there is a lemma stating that the identity function for integers is not equivalent to a bounded integer map `f`. In other words, the image of an integer under the identity function is the integer itself, while the image of an integer under `f` is a bounded integer. Therefore, the identity function and `f` are not the same.", "statement": "lemma (in real1) Real_ZF_1_1_L7:\n  assumes A1: \"f \\<in> BoundedIntMaps\"\n  shows \"\\<not>(id(int) \\<sim> f)\"\n  "}
