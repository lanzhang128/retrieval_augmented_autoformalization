{"informal": " If function f from X to X satisfies: 1) domain of X, 2) p is an element of X, 3) p is a fixpoint of f, and 4) f restricted to X without p is the identity function on X without p, then f is the identity function on X.", "statement": "lemma id_fixpoint_rem: assumes A1: \"f:X\\<rightarrow>X\" and\n  A2: \"p\\<in>X\" and A3: \"f`(p) = p\" and \n  A4: \"restrict(f, X-{p}) = id(X-{p})\"\n  shows \"f = id(X)\"\n"}
