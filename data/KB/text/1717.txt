{"text": "text\\<open>The definition of the product \n  \\<open>\\<pr>(A,a) \\<equiv> SetFold(f,a,A,r)\\<close> of a some (finite) set of \n  semigroup elements requires that $r$ is a linear order on the set \n  of indices $A$. This is necessary so that we know in which order\n  we are multiplying the elements. The product over $A$ is defined \n  so that we have $\\prod_A a = \\prod a \\circ \\sigma(A)$ where\n  $\\sigma : |A| \\rightarrow A$ is the enumeration of $A$ (the only\n  order isomorphism between the number of elements in $A$ and $A$), see\n  lemma \\<open>setproddef\\<close>.\n  However, if the operation is commutative, the order is irrelevant. \n  The next theorem formalizes that fact stating that we can replace\n  the enumeration $\\sigma (A)$ by any bijection between $|A|$ and $A$.\n  In a way this is a generalization of \\<open>setproddef\\<close>. \n  The proof is based on application of \\<open>prod_list_of_sets\\<close>\n  to the finite collection of singletons that comprise $A$.\\<close>\n"}
