{"text": "text\\<open>Transitivity for \"is a subgroup of\" relation. The proof (probably) uses the lemma \n  \\<open>restrict_restrict\\<close> from standard Isabelle/ZF library which states that \n  \\<open>restrict(restrict(f,A),B) = restrict(f,A\\<inter>B)\\<close>. That lemma is added to the simplifier, so it does\n  not have to be referenced explicitly in the proof below. \\<close>\n"}
