{"text": "text\\<open>We know  from \\<open>Group_ZF_3.thy\\<close> that finite range functions are almost homomorphisms. \n  Besides reminding that fact for slopes the next lemma shows \n  that finite range functions do not belong to \\<open>\\<S>\\<^sub>+\\<close>. \n  This is important, because the projection\n  of the set of finite range functions defines zero in the real number construction in \\<open>Real_ZF_x.thy\\<close> \n  series, while the projection of \\<open>\\<S>\\<^sub>+\\<close> becomes the set of (strictly) positive reals. \n  We don't want zero to be positive, do we?
