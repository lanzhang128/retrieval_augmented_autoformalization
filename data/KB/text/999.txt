{"text": "text\\<open> If we assume that the order on the group makes the positive set a meet semi-lattice (i.e.\n  every two-element subset of $G_+$ has a greatest lower bound) then \n  the collection of disks centered at points of the space and with radii in the positive set \n  of the group satisfies the base condition. The meet semi-lattice assumption can be weakened \n  to \"each two-element subset of $G_+$ has a lower bound in $G_+$\", but we don't do that here. \\<close>\n"}
