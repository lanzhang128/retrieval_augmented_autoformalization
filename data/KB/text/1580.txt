{"text": "text\\<open>The next lemma provides sufficient condition for an odd function \n  to be an almost homomorphism. \n  It says for odd functions we only need to check that \n  the homomorphism difference\n  (denoted \\<open>\\<delta>\\<close> in the \\<open>real1\\<close> context) is bounded on positive \n  integers. This is really proven in \\<open>Int_ZF_2.thy\\<close>, but we\n  restate it here for convenience. Recall from \\<open>Group_ZF_3.thy\\<close> that\n  \\<open>OddExtension\\<close> of a function defined on the set of positive elements\n  (of an ordered group) is the only odd function that is equal to the given\n  one when restricted to positive elements.\\<close>\n"}
