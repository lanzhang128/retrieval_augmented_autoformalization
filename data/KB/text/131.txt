{"text": "text\\<open>Field is a notrivial commutative ring such that all \n  non-zero elements have an inverse. We define the notion of being a field as\n  a statement about three sets. The first set, denoted \\<open>K\\<close> is the \n  carrier of the field. The second set, denoted \\<open>A\\<close> represents the \n  additive operation on \\<open>K\\<close> (recall that in ZF set theory functions \n  are sets). The third set \\<open>M\\<close> represents the multiplicative operation \n  on \\<open>K\\<close>.\\<close>\n"}
