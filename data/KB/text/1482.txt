{"text": "text\\<open>The next lemma is rephrases the result from \\<open>Group_ZF_3.thy\\<close>\n  that says that the negative (the group inverse with respect to real \n  addition) of the class of a slope is the class of that slope \n  composed with the integer additive group inverse. The result and proof is not\n  very readable as we use mostly generic set theory notation with long names \n  here. \\<open>Real_ZF_1.thy\\<close> contains the same statement written in a more\n  readable notation: $[-s] = -[s]$.\\<close>\n"}
