{"text": "text\\<open>Recall that $f$ is a slope iff $f(m+n)-f(m)-f(n)$ is bounded\n  as $m,n$ ranges over integers. The next lemma is the first \n  step in showing that we only need to check this condition as $m,n$ ranges\n  over positive intergers. Namely we show that if the condition holds for\n  positive integers, then it holds if one integer is positive and the second \n  one is nonnegative.\\<close>\n"}
