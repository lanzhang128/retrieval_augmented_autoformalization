{"text": "text\\<open>\\<open>Int_ZF_2_4_L12\\<close> is almost what we need, except that it has an assumption\n  that the values of the slope that we get the inverse for are not smaller than $2$ on\n  positive integers. The Arthan's proof of Theorem 11 has a mistake where he says \"note that\n  for all but finitely many $m,n\\in N$ $p=g(m)$ and $q=g(n)$ are both positive\". Of course\n  there may be infinitely many pairs $\\langle m,n \\rangle$ such that $p,q$ are not both \n  positive. This is however easy to workaround: we just modify the slope by adding a \n  constant so that the slope is large enough on positive integers and then look \n  for the inverse.\\<close>\n"}
