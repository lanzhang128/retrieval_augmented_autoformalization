{"text": "text\\<open>A binary function $f: X\\times X \\rightarrow Y$ is commutative\n  if $f\\langle x,y \\rangle = f\\langle y,x \\rangle$. Note that\n  in the definition of associativity above we talk about binary\n  ''operation'' and here we say use the term binary ''function''. \n  This is not set in stone, but usually the word \"operation\" is used \n  when the range is a factor of the domain, while the word \"function\"\n  allows the range to be a completely unrelated set.\\<close>\n"}
