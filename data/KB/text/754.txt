{"text": "text\\<open>If a function is larger than some constant for arguments large\n  enough, then the image of a set that is bounded below is bounded below.\n  This is not true for ordered groups in general, but only for those for which\n  bounded sets are finite.\n  This does not require the function to have infinite limit, but such \n  functions do have this property.\\<close>\n"}
