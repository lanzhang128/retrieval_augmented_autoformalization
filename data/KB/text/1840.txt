{"text": "text\\<open>A criterion for a collection to be a base for a topology\n  that is a slight reformulation of the definition. The only thing\n  different that in the definition is that we assume only that\n  every open set is a union of some sets from the base. The definition\n  requires also the opposite inclusion that every union of the \n  sets from the base is open, but that we can prove if we assume that\n  $T$ is a topology.\\<close>\n"}
