{"text": "text\\<open>We will construct a topology as the collection of unions of (would-be)\n  base. First we prove that if the collection of sets satisfies the \n  condition we want to show to be sufficient, the the intersection belongs\n  to what we will define as topology (am I clear here?). Having this fact \n  ready simplifies the proof of the next lemma. There is not much topology\n  here, just some set theory.\\<close>\n"}
