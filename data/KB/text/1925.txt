{"text": "text\\<open>Intuitively, the topological space of singleton lists valued in $X$ \n  is the same as $X$. However, each element of this space is a list of length one,\n  i.e a set consisting of a pair $\\langle 0, x\\rangle$ where $x$ is an element of $X$.\n  The next lemma provides a formula for the product topology in the corner case when we have \n  only one factor and shows that the product topology of one space is essentially the same as \n  the space.\\<close>\n"}
