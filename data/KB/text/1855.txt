{"text": "text\\<open>Suppose we have subsets $A\\subseteq X, B\\subseteq Y$, where\n  $X,Y$ are topological spaces with topologies $T,S$. We can the consider\n  relative topologies on $T_A, S_B$ on sets $A,B$ and the collection\n  of cartesian products of sets open in $T_A, S_B$, (namely \n  $\\{U\\times V: U\\in T_A, V\\in S_B\\}$. The next lemma states that\n  this collection is a base of the product topology on $X\\times Y$\n  restricted to the product $A\\times B$.\\<close>\n"}
