{"text": "text\\<open>We define the group inverse as the set\n  $\\{\\langle x,y \\rangle \\in G\\times G: x\\cdot y = e \\}$, where $e$ is the\n  neutral element of the group. This set (which can be written as \n  $(\\cdot)^{-1}\\{ e\\}$) is a certain relation on the group (carrier). \n  Since, as we show later, for every $x\\in G$ there is exactly one $y\\in G$\n  such that $x \\cdot y = e$  this relation is in fact a function from $G$ to $G$.\\<close>\n"}
