{"text": "text\\<open>To shorten the definition of the function generating the Pascal's trangle we first\n  define expression for the k'th element in the row following given row $r$. \n  The rows are represented as lists, i.e. functions $r:n\\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}$ (recall that\n  for natural numbers we have $n=\\{ 0,1,2,...,n-1\\})$.\n  The value of the next row is 1 at the beginning and equals $r(k-1)+r(k)$ \n  otherwise. A careful reader might wonder why we do not require the values to be 1\n  on the right boundary of the Pascal's triangle. We are able to show this as a theorem \n  (see \\<open>binom_right_boundary\\<close> below) using the fact that in Isabelle/ZF the value of a function\n  on an argument that is outside of the domain is the empty set, which is the same as zero of \n  natural numbers. \\<close>\n"}
