{"text": "text\\<open>The next theorem rephrases lemmas \n  \\<open>OrderedGroup_ZF_5_L5\\<close> and \\<open>OrderedGroup_ZF_5_L6\\<close>\n  using the definition of the order from the positive set \n  \\<open>OrderFromPosSet\\<close>. To summarize, this is what it says:\n  Suppose that $H\\subseteq G$ is a set closed under that group operation\n  such that $1\\notin H$ and for every nonunit group element $a$ either $a\\in H$\n  or $a^{-1}\\in H$. Define the order as $a\\leq b$ iff $a=b$ or \n  $a^{-1}\\cdot b \\in H$. Then this order makes $G$ into a linearly ordered \n  group such $H$ is the set of positive elements (and then of course \n  $H \\cup \\{1\\}$ is the set of nonnegative elements).\\<close>\n"}
