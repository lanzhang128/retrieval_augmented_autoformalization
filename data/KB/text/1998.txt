{"text": "text\\<open>Here is an example of the spectrum. The proof lies in the indiscrite filter \\<open>{A}\\<close>\nthat can be build for any set. In this proof, we see that without choice,\nthere is no way to define the sepctrum of a property with cardinals because if a set is not \ncomparable with any ordinal, its cardinal is defined as \\<open>0\\<close> without the set being\nempty.\\<close>\n"}
