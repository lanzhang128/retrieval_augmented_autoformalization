{"text": "text\\<open>Let's show that anti-hyperconnected is in fact $T_1$ and sober. The trick of the proof lies\nin the fact that if a subset is hyperconnected, its closure is so too (the closure of a point\nis then always hyperconnected because singletons are in the spectrum); since the closure\nis closed, we can apply the sober property on it.\\<close>\n"}
