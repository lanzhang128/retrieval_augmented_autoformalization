{"text": "text\\<open>The next lemma is a bit displaced as it is mainly \n  about finite sets. It is proven here because it uses\n  the notion of \\<open>Append\\<close>.\n  Suppose we have a list of element of $A$ is a bijection.\n  Then for every element that does not belong to $A$ \n  we can we can construct \n  a bijection for the set $A \\cup \\{ x\\}$ by appending $x$.\n  This is just a specialised version of lemma \\<open>bij_extend_point\\<close>\n  from \\<open>func1.thy\\<close>.\n\\<close>\n"}
