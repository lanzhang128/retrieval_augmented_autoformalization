{"text": "text\\<open>The first assertion of the next theorem is similar in content to \\<open>seq_sum_pull_first0\\<close> \n  formulated in terms of the expression defining the list of monoid elements. The second\n  one shows the dual statement: the last element of a sequence can be pulled out of the\n  sequence and put after the summation sign.
