{"text": "text\\<open>A technical lemma about a decomposition of a sum of two natural\n  numbers: if a number $i$ is from $m + n$ then it is either from $m$\n  or can be written as a sum of $m$ and a number from $n$. \n  The proof by induction w.r.t. to $m$ seems to be a bit heavy-handed, but I could\n  not figure out how to do this directly from results from standard Isabelle/ZF.\\<close>\n"}
