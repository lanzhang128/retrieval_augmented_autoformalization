{"text": "text\\<open>The homomorphism difference in multiplicative notation is defined as\n  the expression $s(m\\cdot n)\\cdot(s(m)\\cdot s(n))^{-1}$. The next lemma \n  shows that \n  in the additive notation used for integers the homomorphism \n  difference is $f(m+n) - f(m) - f(n)$ which we denote as \\<open>\\<delta>(f,m,n)\\<close>.\\<close>\n"}
