{"text": "text\\<open>Now, we could wonder if the class of compact spaces and the class of lindeloef spaces being equal\nis consistent in ZF. Let's find a topological space which is lindeloef and no compact\nwithout assuming any axiom of choice or any negation of one. This will prove\nthat the class of lindeloef spaces and the class of compact spaces cannot be equal\nin any model of ZF.\\<close>\n"}
