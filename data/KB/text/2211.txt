{"text": "text\\<open>If we have a uniformity $\\Phi$ we can create a neighborhood system from it in two ways.\n  We can create a a neighborhood system directly from $\\Phi$ using the formula \n  $X \\ni x \\mapsto \\{V\\{x\\} | x\\in X\\}$ (see theorem \\<open>neigh_from_uniformity\\<close>).\n  Alternatively we can construct a topology from $\\Phi$ as in theorem \n  \\<open>uniform_top_is_top\\<close> and then create a neighborhood system from this topology\n  as in theorem \\<open>neigh_from_topology\\<close>. The next theorem states that these two ways give the same \n  result. \\<close>\n"}
