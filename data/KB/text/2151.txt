{"text": "text\\<open>This last corollary has an explanation: In Hausdorff spaces, compact sets are closed\nand regular spaces are exactly the \"locally closed spaces\"(those which have a neighbourhood basis of closed sets).\nSo the neighbourhood basis of compact sets also works as the neighbourhood basis of closed sets we needed to find.\\<close>\n"}
