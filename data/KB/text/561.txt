{"text": "text\\<open>Composition of a. h. to is congruent\n  with respect to the quotient group relation for the subgroup of finite \n  range functions. Recall that if an operation say \"$\\circ $\" on $X$ is \n  congruent with respect to an equivalence relation $R$ then we can \n  define the operation \n  on the quotient space $X/R$ by $[s]_R\\circ [r]_R := [s\\circ r]_R$ and this\n  definition will be correct i.e. it will not depend on the choice of \n  representants for the classes $[x]$ and $[y]$. This is why we want it here.\\<close>\n"}
