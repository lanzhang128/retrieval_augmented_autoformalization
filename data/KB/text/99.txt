{"text": "text\\<open>Now we will define the projection of\n  a function onto the quotient space. In standard math the equivalence class\n  of $x$ with respect to relation $r$ is usually denoted $[x]_r$. Here we reuse\n  notation $r\\{ x\\}$ instead. This means the image of the set $\\{ x\\}$ \n  with respect to the relation, which, for equivalence relations is \n  exactly its equivalence class if you think about it.\\<close>\n"}
