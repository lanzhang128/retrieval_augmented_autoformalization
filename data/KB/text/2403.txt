{"text": "text\\<open>Since we are writing in generic set notation, \n  the definition below is a bit complicated. Here it what it says:\n  Given a set $X$ and another set $f$ (that represents a binary function on $X$) \n  we are defining $f$ lifted to function space over $X$\n  as the binary function (a set of pairs) on the space \n  $F = X \\rightarrow \\textrm{range}(f)$ such that the value of this function\n  on pair $\\langle a,b \\rangle$ of functions on $X$ is another function $c$ on $X$\n  with values defined by $c(x) = f\\langle a(x), b(x)\\rangle$. \n\\<close>\n"}
