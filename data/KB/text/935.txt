{"text": "text\\<open>The first thing that mathematicians typically do is to define\n  notions. In Isar this is done with the \\<open>definition\\<close> keyword.\n  In our case we define a notion of two \n  sets being disjoint. We will use the infix notation, i.e. the string\n  \\<open>{is disjoint with}\\<close> put between two sets to denote our notion \n  of disjointness. \n  The left side of the \\<open>\\<equiv>\\<close> symbol is the notion \n  being defined, the right side says how we define it. In Isabelle/ZF \\<open>0\\<close>\n  is used to denote both zero (of natural numbers) and the empty set, which is\n  not surprising as those two things are the same in set theory.\\<close>\n"}
