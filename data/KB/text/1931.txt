{"text": "text\\<open>We say that a relation $r$ \\<open>directs\\<close> a set $X$ if the relation is reflexive, transitive\n  on $X$ and for every two elements $x,y$ of $X$ there is some element $z$ such that both\n  $x$ and $y$ are in the relation with $z$. Note that this naming is a bit inconsistent with what\n  is defined in \\<open>Order_ZF\\<close> where we define what it means that $r$ \\<open>up-directs\\<close> $X$ \n  (the third condition in the definition below) or $r$ \\<open>down-directs\\<close> $X$. This naming inconsistency\n   will be fixed in the future (maybe).\\<close>\n"}
