{"text": "text\\<open> The notion of \"having a supremum\" is the same as the set of upper bounds having a\n  minimum, but having it a a separate notion does simplify notation in some cases.\n  The definition is written in terms of \n  images of singletons $\\{ x\\}$ under relation. To understand this formulation note\n  that the set of upper bounds of a set $A\\subseteq X$ is \n  $\\bigcap_{x\\in A}\\{ y\\in X | \\langle x,y\\rangle \\in r \\}$, which is the same\n  as $\\bigcap_{x\\in A} r(\\{ x \\})$, where $r(\\{ x \\})$ is the image of the singleton $\\{ x\\}$ under\n  relation $r$. \\<close>\n"}
