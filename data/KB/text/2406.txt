{"text": "text\\<open>Typically we say that a binary operation \"$\\cdot $\" \n  on a set $G$ is ''associative''\n  if $(x\\cdot y)\\cdot z = x\\cdot (y\\cdot z)$ for all $x,y,z \\in G$.\n  Our actual definition below does not use the multiplicative notation\n  so that we can apply it equally to the additive notation $+$ \n  or whatever infix symbol we may want to use. \n  Instead, we use the generic set theory notation\n  and write $P\\langle x,y \\rangle$ to denote the value of the operation\n  $P$ on a pair $\\langle x,y \\rangle \\in G\\times G$.\\<close>\n"}
