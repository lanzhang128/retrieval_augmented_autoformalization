{"text": "text\\<open>Given two topological spaces we can define a topology on the product of \n  the carriers such that the cartesian products of the sets of the topologies \n  are a base for the product topology. Recall that for two collections $S,T$ \n  of sets the product collection is defined (in \\<open>ZF1.thy\\<close>) as the collections of cartesian \n  products $A\\times B$, where $A\\in S, B\\in T$. The $T\\times_tS$ notation is defined as\n  an alternative to the verbose  \\<open>ProductTopology(T,S)\\<close>). \\<close>\n"}
