{"text": "text\\<open>A neccessary condition for two slopes to be almost equal. \n  For slopes the definition postulates the \n  set $\\{f(m)-g(m): m\\in Z\\}$ to be finite. \n  This lemma shows that this implies that\n  $|f(m)-g(m)|$ is bounded (by some integer) as $m$ varies over integers.\n  We also mention here that in this context \\<open>s \\<sim> r\\<close> implies that both\n  $s$ and $r$ are slopes.\\<close>\n"}
