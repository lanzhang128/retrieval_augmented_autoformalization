{"text": "text\\<open> We define a neighborhood system as a function that takes each point $x\\in X$ and assigns it \n  a collection of subsets of $X$ which is called the neighborhoods of $x$. \n  The neighborhoods of a point $x$ form a filter that satisfies an additional\n  axiom that for every neighborhood $N$ of $x$ we can find another one $U$ such that $N$ \n  is a neighborhood of every point of $U$. \\<close>\n"}
