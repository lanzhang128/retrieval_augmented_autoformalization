{"text": "text\\<open>The spectrum of Luzin spaces is the class of countable sets, so there\nare lots of examples of Luzin spaces.\\<close>\n", "informal": " The statement \"A is in the spectrum of Luzin if and only if A is bounded by natural numbers.\" \n\nHere is a more detailed explanation:\n\nThe \"spectrum of Luzin\" refers to a specific subset of real numbers introduced by Luzin in the context of Measurable Functions in Mathematical Analysis. However, without more context or background information, it's difficult to provide a precise definition of this term in natural language.\n\nBut based on the Isabelle/ZF code snippet, the lemma \"spectrum_Luzin\" seems to be stating that a real number A belongs to the spectrum of Luzin if and only if it is bounded by natural numbers (i.e., the set {n \u2208 nat | A \u2264 n} is nonempty). This means that 'A' is limited by some natural number, and this condition is also necessary for a number to be in the spectrum of Luzin.", "statement": "lemma spectrum_Luzin:\n  shows \"(A{is in the spectrum of}IsLuzin) \\<longleftrightarrow> A\\<lesssim>nat\"\n"}
