{"text": "text\\<open>The open intervals and rays satisfy the base condition.\\<close>\n", "informal": " Given a linearly ordered set X with respect to the relation r, the union of the intervals, left rays, and right rays defined over X and r with base b satisfies the base condition. \n\nHere's a more detailed explanation for those not familiar with Isabelle/ZF: \n\nThe lemma `intervals_rays_base_condition` makes an assumption that X is a linearly ordered set with respect to the relation r. Using this assumption, the lemma proves that a certain set, which consists of unions of three sets, satisfies a base condition. \n\nThe first set in the union is the set of intervals with base b, which is defined as the set of all sets of the form {a,b}|a, b \u2208 X, a < b, ordered with set inclusion.\n\nThe second set is the set of left rays with base b, which is defined as the set of all sets of the form {a,b}|a, b \u2208 X, a < b, and for all c such that a < c < b, we have c \u2208 X.\n\nThe third set is the set of right rays with base b, which is defined as the set of all sets of the form {a,b}|a, b \u2208 X, a < b, and for all c such that a < c < b, we have c \u2208 X and c \u2264 b.\n\nThese three sets are created for every base b \u2208 X that belongs to X. The lemma then proves that the union of these sets with respect to set union satisfies a base condition. The precise meaning of the base condition depends on the context of the theorem in which this lemma is used. Generally, this base condition refers to a property that is needed to ensure that the definitions of certain mathematical constructs (such as topology, integration, or measures) are well-defined.", "statement": "lemma intervals_rays_base_condition:\n  assumes \"IsLinOrder(X,r)\"\n  shows \"{IntervalX(X,r,b,c). \\<langle>b,c\\<rangle>\\<in>X\\<times>X}\\<union>{LeftRayX(X,r,b). b\\<in>X}\\<union>{RightRayX(X,r,b). b\\<in>X} {satisfies the base condition}\"\n"}
