{"text": "text\\<open>The lemma below lists some properties that\n  require two real numbers to state.\\<close>\n", "informal": " Given real numbers a and b, the sum a + b, difference a - b, product ab, and quotient a / b (assuming a != 0) are also real numbers. Furthermore, the following properties hold: the order of addiction is commutative (a + b = b + a), the multiplication is commutative and distributive with respect to addition (a * (b + c) = (a * b) + (a * c), a * (b * c) = (a * b) * c), and the division is distributive with respect to multiplication (a / (b * c) = (a / b) * (1 / c)). \n\nIn your Isabelle/ZF code, you stated that 'a and 'b belong to the set of real numbers, and you are proving several theorems about their arithmetic operations. This lemma named Real_ZF_1_L6 asserts that the sum, difference, product, and quotient of real numbers 'a and 'b are also real numbers. Additionally, it declares some relationships between these arithmetic operations.\n\nThese properties are as follows:\n\n1. Real number a and real number b have the sum 'a + 'b, which is another real number.\n2. Real number a and real number b have the difference 'a - 'b, which is another real number.\n3. Real number a and real number b have the product 'a * 'b, which is another real number.\n\nHere's a more natural English version:\n\nAssuming numbers 'a and 'b are real, the following arithmetic operations are also real:\nsum: 'a + 'b\ndifference: 'a - 'b\nmultiplication: 'a * 'b\nquotient: 'a / 'b (provided 'a is nonzero)\n\nMoreover, the following relationships hold among these operations:\ncommutativity of sum: 'a + 'b = 'b + 'a\ncommutativity and distributivity of multiplication:\n- 'a * (('b + 'c)) = ('a * 'b) + ('a * 'c)\n- 'a * ('b * 'c) = ('a * 'b) * 'c\ndistributivity of division: 'a / ('b * 'c) = ('a / 'b) * (1 / 'c)\n\nSo, the statement \"Real_ZF_1_L6: assumes \"a\\<in>\\<real>\"  \"b\\<in>\\<real>\" shows ... \" is proving these properties for given real numbers 'a and 'b in Isabelle/ZF setting.", "statement": "lemma (in real0) Real_ZF_1_L6: assumes \"a\\<in>\\<real>\"  \"b\\<in>\\<real>\"\n  shows \n  \"a\\<ra>b \\<in> \\<real>\" \n  \"a\\<rs>b \\<in> \\<real>\" \n  \"a\\<cdot>b \\<in> \\<real>\" \n  \"a\\<ra>b = b\\<ra>a\"\n  \"(\\<rm>a)\\<cdot>b = \\<rm>(a\\<cdot>b)\" \n  \"a\\<cdot>(\\<rm>b) = \\<rm>(a\\<cdot>b)\"\n  "}
