{"text": "text\\<open> There are several definitions of uniform spaces. \n  The fact that these definitions are equivalent is far from obvious\n  (some people call such phenomenon cryptomorphism). \n  We will use the definition of the uniform structure (or ''uniformity'') \n  based on entourages. This was the original definition by Weil and it seems \n  to be the most commonly used.\n  A uniformity consists of entourages that are binary relations between points of space $X$ \n  that satisfy a certain collection of conditions, specified below. \\<close>\n", "informal": " A uniformity on a set X is a filter on X \u00d7 X satisfying the following conditions:\n\n1. It is a filter on X \u00d7 X.\n2. For each element U in the uniformity, id(X) (the identity relation on X) is a subset of U.\n3. For each element U in the uniformity, there exists an element V in the uniformity such that V contains its diagonal (V \u2229 V) and is a subset of U.\n4.
