The lemma then concludes that StrictVersion(r) is transitive, where StrictVersion(r) is the strict (irreflexive and transitive) version of relation r. Essentially, this means that if StrictVersion(r) holds between x and y, then neither x nor y can be related to themselves, and it also holds between any pair of elements if one is related to the other through r but not themselves. The lemma states that if r has the transitive and antisymmetric properties, then StrictVersion(r) will also have the transitive property.", "statement": "lemma strict_of_transB: \n  assumes A1: \"trans(r)\" and A2: \"antisym(r)\"\n  shows \"trans(StrictVersion(r))\"\n"}
