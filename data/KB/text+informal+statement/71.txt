In natural language, the statement can be thought of as:\n\n1. `a` is a real number.\n2. There exists a real number `x` such that:`\n   a. `a` is equal to the negative of `x` squared.\n   a. `x` is a real number.\n\nIn brief, given that `a` is a real number, there is a real number `x` such that `a = -x * x`.", "statement": "lemma (in complex0) axrnegex: assumes A1: \"a\\<in>\\<real>\"\n  shows \"\\<exists> x \\<in> \\<real>. a \\<ca> x = \\<zero>\"\n"}
