And A and B are elements of their finite power sets, with A being an element of X's power set and B an element of Y's power set. Moreover, A is approximately equal to B. The lemma states that the order isomorphism from A to B, with respect to X's and Y's orders, is not equal to zero. In other words, there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the elements in A and B that preserves the order relationships.", "statement": "lemma fin_ord_iso_ex: \n  assumes A1: \"IsLinOrder(X,r)\"  \"IsLinOrder(Y,R)\" and\n  A2: \"A \\<in> FinPow(X)\" \"B \\<in> FinPow(Y)\" and A3: \"B \\<approx> A\"\n  shows \"ord_iso(A,r,B,R) \\<noteq> 0\"\n"}
