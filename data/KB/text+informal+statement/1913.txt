{"text": "text\\<open>A typical statement of the pasting lemma uses the notion of a function \nrestricted to a set being continuous without specifying the topologies with \nrespect to which this continuity holds.\nIn \\<open>two_top_spaces0\\<close> context the notation \\<open>g {is continuous}\\<close>\nmeans continuity wth respect to topologies $\\tau_1, \\tau_2$.\nThe next lemma is a special case of \\<open>partial_fun_cont\\<close> and states that if\nfor some set $A\\subseteq X_1=\\bigcup \\tau_1$\nthe function $f|_A$ is continuous (with respect to $(\\tau_1, \\tau_2)$), then \n$A$ has to be open.
