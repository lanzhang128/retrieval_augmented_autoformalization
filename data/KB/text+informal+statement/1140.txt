In simpler terms, Infim(B, A, R) is the same as the \"greatest lower bound\" of set A in the context of set B and the relation R. The equivalent operation is known as a supremum, but we take the converse of relation R to find this bound.", "statement": "definition\n  \"Infim(B,A,R) \\<equiv> Sup(B,A,converse(R))\"\n"}
