{"text": "text\\<open>The next theorem resolves that the axiom of \\<open>Q\\<close> choice for subsets\nof \\<open>\\<Union>T\\<close> is necessary for second type spaces to be separable of the same cardinal\n\\<open>csucc(Q)\\<close>.\\<close>\n", "informal": " Assume that for every topology T of second type cardinality greater than Q, if T is of second category and is not separable of cardinality greater than Q, then there exists an element in Q that is not contained in M, and M is a proper subset of Q such that every element in M has a non-empty intersection with N.\n\nShow that the axiom of choice holds for Q.\n\nProof:\n\nAssume that for every set {A : _} in Q, there exists no function {f : Q -> Q} such that for all {x : Q}, {f x} is in A. We want to derive a contradiction.\n\nBy the given assumption, there exists an element q in Q that is not in the union of all sets in M. Since M is not empty and each element in M is not the empty set (by the second assumption), we can choose an element m in M that intersects non-empty with N.\n\nDefine a relation r on Q x Q as follows: (x, y) in r if y is in x or y intersects m and x intersects m. This relation is reflexive, since any element intersects itself. It is symmetric, since if (x, y) is in r, then (y, x) is also in r due to the symmetry of intersection. Finally, it is transitive, since if (x, y) and (y, z) are in r, then x intersects m (since y intersects m and m intersects both x and z).\n\nWe will show that there exists a choice function for the family {A : _} in Q. For each a in Q, define Fa as the set {x : Q} such that x intersects m and x is disjoint from {a}. Since a is not in the union of sets in M and m intersects every set in M (as each set in M intersects N, which in turn intersects m), Fa is a non-empty set for every a.\n\nNotice that if x and y are both in Fa, then they are disjoint, since m is their only element of intersection, and since m is disjoint from both x and y. Therefore, the Axiom of Choice applies to the family {Fa : a in Q}, giving us a function g such that for all a in Q, g a is in Fa and is an element chosen from Fa.\n\nNow define a function f : Q -> Q as follows: for each x in Q, choose y in M such that x intersects m and y intersects m. If such a y exists, define f(x) = y; otherwise, define f(x) to be any element in Fa(x) that is also in N.\n\nWe claim that f(x) is in A for every A in Q. Assume for contradiction that there exists an A in Q such that f(x) is not in A for some x in Q. Since A is not empty (as it contains at least one element from Q), there must exist some y in A such that y intersects m.\n\nSince a is neither in N nor in the union of sets in M (by the first assumption), neither is it in any set in M. Since M is a cover of Q (as every element in Q intersects some set in M, namely m), a must intersect some set in M, say m'. Since we assumed that a is not in the union of sets in M, a must intersect m' strictly, meaning a intersects m' but m' does not intersect a.\n\nNote that since m intersection m' intersects m, it also intersects a. However, since a is disjoint from every set in M, it cannot intersect m', which leads to a contradiction. Therefore, f(x) must be in A for every A in Q, and the Axiom of Choice holds for Q.\n\nQ.E.D.", "statement": "theorem second_imp_separable_imp_Q_choice:\n  assumes \"\\<forall>T.
