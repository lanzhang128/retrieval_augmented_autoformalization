{"text": "text\\<open>In the \\<open>Topology_ZF_2\\<close> theory we define product topology of two topological spaces.\nThe next lemma explains in what sense the topology on finite lists of length $n$ of \nelements of topological space $X$ can be thought as a model of the product topology on the cartesian \nproduct of $n$ copies of that space. Namely, we show that the space of lists of length $n+1$ \nof elements of $X$  is homeomorphic to the product topology (as defined in \\<open>Topology_ZF_2\\<close>) \nof two spaces: the space of lists of length $n$ and $X$.
