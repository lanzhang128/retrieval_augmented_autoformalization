{"text": "text\\<open>Properties with one integer.\\<close>\n", "informal": " Assuming a is an integer, we have the following equalities: a raised to the power of zero is equal to a, zero raised to the power of a is equal to zero, a multiplied by one is equal to a, one multiplied by a is equal to a, zero multiplied by a is equal to zero, and a multiplied by zero is equal to zero. Also, the same number negated is equal to its additive inverse, and a raised to the power of two is equal to a squared. Furthermore, the negation of a is an integer, and applying the negation operator twice to a results in the original integer. Lastly, a raised to the succeding zero, aka a successor zero, is equal to a itself, and a succeding any integer is an integer.", "statement": "lemma (in int0) Int_ZF_1_1_L4: assumes A1: \"a \\<in> \\<int>\"\n  shows \n  \"a\\<ra>\\<zero> = a\" \n  \"\\<zero>\\<ra>a = a\" \n  \"a\\<cdot>\\<one> = a\"   \"\\<one>\\<cdot>a = a\"\n  \"\\<zero>\\<cdot>a = \\<zero>\"   \"a\\<cdot>\\<zero> = \\<zero>\" \n  \"(\\<rm>a) \\<in> \\<int>\"  \"(\\<rm>(\\<rm>a)) = a\"\n  \"a\\<rs>a = \\<zero>\"   \"a\\<rs>\\<zero> = a\"  \"\\<two>\\<cdot>a = a\\<ra>a\"\n"}
