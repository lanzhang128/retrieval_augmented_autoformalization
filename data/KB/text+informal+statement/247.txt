{"text": "text\\<open>There is a natural bijection between the space $(n+1)\\rightarrow X$ of lists of length \n$n+1$ of elements of $X$ and the cartesian product $(n\\rightarrow X)\\times X$.\\<close>\n", "informal": " Given a natural number n, the family of tuples {<(x, Init(x), x!(n))> | x in succ(n)} is bijectible with the Cartesian product of the set of functions from n to X and X.\n\nHere's a more detailed explanation, but try to keep it as brief as possible:\n\nLet n be a natural number. The set S, defined as {<(x, Init(x), x!(n))> | x is in succ(n)} is bijectable with the Cartesian product of the set F of functions from n to X and X, denoted as (n -> X) x X. The Cartesian product (n -> X) x X consists of all ordered pairs <(f, x)> where f is a function from n to X and x is an element in X.\n\nThe function F is said to be a bijection if it (1) is a function (injective) and (2) every element in the range (surjective) has exactly one preimage.\n\nFormally, the statement uses the bij function in Isabelle/ZF, which takes in the domain and range of the bijective function and returns the bijection itself. In this situation, succ(n) is the domain, X is the range, and the function F is defined implicitly through the assumption \"x in succ(n) -> X\", which states that every element in the range X is the third component of an element in set S.\n\nSo, in simpler terms, the code implies that for each x in the list fromInitToEnd of the numbers from 0 to succ(n), the pairs (x, init(x), x!(n)) form a one-to-one correspondence with the Cartesian product of the set of functions from 0 to n to X and X.", "statement": "lemma lists_cart_prod: assumes \"n \\<in> nat\"\n  shows \"{\\<langle>x,\\<langle>Init(x),x`(n)\\<rangle>\\<rangle>. x \\<in> succ(n)\\<rightarrow>X} \\<in> bij(succ(n)\\<rightarrow>X,(n\\<rightarrow>X)\\<times>X)\"\n"}
