In other words, a filter converges to a set F if all its elements belong to the union of T and are included in the neutral elements of the filter when considered as subsets.", "statement": "definition (in topology0)\n  FilterConverges (\"_ \\<rightarrow>\\<^sub>F _\" 50) where\n  \"\\<FF>{is a filter on}\\<Union>T  \\<Longrightarrow> \\<FF>\\<rightarrow>\\<^sub>Fx \\<equiv>\n  x\\<in>\\<Union>T \\<and> ({U\\<in>Pow(\\<Union>T). x\\<in>int(U)} \\<subseteq> \\<FF>)\"\n"}
