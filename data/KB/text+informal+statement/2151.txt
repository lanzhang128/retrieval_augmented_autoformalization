{"text": "text\\<open>This last corollary has an explanation: In Hausdorff spaces, compact sets are closed\nand regular spaces are exactly the \"locally closed spaces\"(those which have a neighbourhood basis of closed sets).\nSo the neighbourhood basis of compact sets also works as the neighbourhood basis of closed sets we needed to find.\\<close>\n", "informal": " A set T is locally closed if and only if every subset B of T is closed in T.", "statement": "definition\n  IsLocallyClosed (\"_{is locally-closed}\")\n  where \"T{is locally-closed} \\<equiv> T{is locally}(\\<lambda>B TT.
