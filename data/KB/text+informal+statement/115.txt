{"text": "text\\<open>Congruent functions of two variables can be projected.\\<close>\n", "informal": " If relation `r` makes `A` an equivalence relation and function `f` is a congruence for `r`, then `ProjFun2(A, r, f)` is a well-defined function from the quotient `(A // r) x (A // r)` to `A // r`. \n\nHere's a brief explanation:\n\nAssume `A` is an equipotent set and `r` is an equivalence relation over it. Moreover, let `f` be a function that is a congruence with respect to `r`. Then `ProjFun2(A, r, f)` is a well-defined function from the quotient `(A // r) x (A // r)` to `A // r`, where `(A // r)` denotes the equivalence classes of `A` under `r`. This statement verifies that the function `ProjFun2(A, r, f)` used to represent the quotient map preserves the composition of equivalence classes and respects the equivalence relation.", "statement": "theorem EquivClass_1_T1: \n  assumes \"equiv(A,r)\"  \"Congruent2(r,f)\"\n  shows \"ProjFun2(A,r,f) : (A//r)\\<times>(A//r) \\<rightarrow> A//r\"\n  "}
