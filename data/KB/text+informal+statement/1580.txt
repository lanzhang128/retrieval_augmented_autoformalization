{"text": "text\\<open>The next lemma provides sufficient condition for an odd function \n  to be an almost homomorphism. \n  It says for odd functions we only need to check that \n  the homomorphism difference\n  (denoted \\<open>\\<delta>\\<close> in the \\<open>real1\\<close> context) is bounded on positive \n  integers. This is really proven in \\<open>Int_ZF_2.thy\\<close>, but we\n  restate it here for convenience. Recall from \\<open>Group_ZF_3.thy\\<close> that\n  \\<open>OddExtension\\<close> of a function defined on the set of positive elements\n  (of an ordered group) is the only odd function that is equal to the given\n  one when restricted to positive elements.\\<close>\n", "informal": " Given a function `f` from integers to integes, assuming that the absolute difference between the function values at any two integers is less than a given real number `L`, then the odd extension of `f` using IntegerAddition, IntegerOrder, and the set of reals, is an element of the set `S`.", "statement": "lemma (in real1) Real_ZF_1_4_L21A: \n  assumes A1: \"f:\\<int>\\<^sub>+\\<rightarrow>int\"  \"\\<forall>a\\<in>\\<int>\\<^sub>+. \\<forall>b\\<in>\\<int>\\<^sub>+. abs(\\<delta>(f,a,b)) \\<zlq> L\"\n  shows \"OddExtension(int,IntegerAddition,IntegerOrder,f) \\<in> \\<S>\"\n  "}
