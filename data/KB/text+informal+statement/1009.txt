{"text": "text\\<open>Monoid is a set $G$ with an associative operation and a neutral element.\n  The operation is a function on $G\\times G$ with values in $G$. \n  In the context of ZF set theory this means that it is a set of pairs\n  $\\langle x,y \\rangle$, where $x\\in G\\times G$ and $y\\in G$.
