In natural language, we can interpret this statement as follows:\n\nGiven a set equipped with a metric (a function that measures the distance between any two points), the collection of open balls around each point defines a topology known as the metric topology. This topology has the T2 property, which means that for any two distinct points with non-empty open neighborhoods, these neighborhoods do not overlap. In other words, given distinct points x and y, there exist open sets U containing x and V containing y such that U \u2229 V is empty.", "statement": "theorem (in metric_space1) rmetric_space_T2: shows \"Metric_Topology {is T\\<^sub>2}\"\n  unfolding Open_Balls_def Metric_Topology_def\n  "}
