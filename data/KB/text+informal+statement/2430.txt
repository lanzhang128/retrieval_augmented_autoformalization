{"text": "text\\<open>The next definition describes the notion of a binary operation\n  lifted to subsets. It is written in a way that might be a bit unexpected,\n  but really it is the same as the intuitive definition, but shorter.\n  In the definition we take a pair $p \\in Pow(X)\\times Pow(X)$, say\n  $p = \\langle A, B\\rangle $, where $A,B \\subseteq X$. \n  Then we assign this pair of sets the set \n  $\\{f\\langle x,y \\rangle : x\\in A, y\\in B \\} = \\{ f(x'): x' \\in A\\times B\\}$\n  The set on the right hand side is the same as the image\n  of $A\\times B$ under $f$. In the definition we don't use $A$ and $B$ symbols,\n  but write \\<open>fst(p)\\<close> and \\<open>snd(p)\\<close>, resp. Recall that in Isabelle/ZF\n  \\<open>fst(p)\\<close> and  \\<open>snd(p)\\<close> denote the first and second components\n  of an ordered pair $p$.\n  See the lemma \\<open>lift_subsets_explained\\<close> for a more intuitive\n  notation.\\<close>\n", "informal": " The \"Lift2Subsets\" relation, denoted as \"{lifted to subsets of}\", holds between a function f and a set X if and only if the relation is defined by the following set of pairs: {<p, (f (fst p) * snd p)>. p is an element of the Cartesian product of the power set of X with itself}.", "statement": "definition\n  Lift2Subsets (infix \"{lifted to subsets of}\" 65) where\n  \"f {lifted to subsets of} X \\<equiv> \n  {\\<langle>p, f``(fst(p)\\<times>snd(p))\\<rangle>. p \\<in> Pow(X)\\<times>Pow(X)}\"\n"}
