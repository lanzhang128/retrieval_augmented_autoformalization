{"text": "text\\<open>The definition of the product \n  \\<open>\\<pr>(A,a) \\<equiv> SetFold(f,a,A,r)\\<close> of a some (finite) set of \n  semigroup elements requires that $r$ is a linear order on the set \n  of indices $A$. This is necessary so that we know in which order\n  we are multiplying the elements. The product over $A$ is defined \n  so that we have $\\prod_A a = \\prod a \\circ \\sigma(A)$ where\n  $\\sigma : |A| \\rightarrow A$ is the enumeration of $A$ (the only\n  order isomorphism between the number of elements in $A$ and $A$), see\n  lemma \\<open>setproddef\\<close>.\n  However, if the operation is commutative, the order is irrelevant. \n  The next theorem formalizes that fact stating that we can replace\n  the enumeration $\\sigma (A)$ by any bijection between $|A|$ and $A$.\n  In a way this is a generalization of \\<open>setproddef\\<close>. \n  The proof is based on application of \\<open>prod_list_of_sets\\<close>\n  to the finite collection of singletons that comprise $A$.\\<close>\n", "informal": " Given a commutative semigroup G, a finite non-empty subset A of X, and a bijection b between the elements of A and A, the product of two elements a and b in A is equal to the multiplicative identity of A. \n\nIn other words, if f is a commutative function on a semigroup G, A is a finite non-empty subset of a set X, A is not the empty set, and b is a bijection between the elements of A and itself, then the product of element a in A with element b is equal to the identity element of A.", "statement": "theorem (in semigr1) prod_order_irr: \n  assumes A1: \"f {is commutative on} G\" and\n  A2: \"A \\<in> FinPow(X)\" \"A \\<noteq> 0\" and\n  A3: \"b \\<in> bij(|A|,A)\"\n  shows \"(\\<Prod> (a O b)) = \\<pr>(A,a)\"\n"}
