{"text": "text\\<open>We define a notion of a partition as a set valued function \n  such that the values for different arguments are disjoint.\n  The name is derived from the fact that such \n  function \"partitions\" the union of its arguments. \n  Please let me know if you have \n  a better idea for a name for such notion. We would prefer to say\n ''is a partition'', but that reserves the letter ''a'' as a keyword(?)\n  which causes problems.\\<close>\n", "statement": "definition\n  Partition (\"_ {is partition}\" [90] 91) where\n  \"P {is partition} \\<equiv>  \\<forall>x \\<in> domain(P). \n  P`(x) \\<noteq> 0 \\<and> (\\<forall>y \\<in> domain(P). x\\<noteq>y \\<longrightarrow> P`(x) \\<inter> P`(y) = 0)\"\n"}
