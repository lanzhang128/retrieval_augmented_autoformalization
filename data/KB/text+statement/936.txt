{"text": "text\\<open>We are ready to prove a theorem. Here we show that the relation\n  of being disjoint is symmetric. We start with one of the keywords\n  ''theorem'', ''lemma'' or ''corollary''. In Isar they are synonymous.\n  Then we provide a name for the theorem. In standard mathematics \n  theorems are numbered. In Isar we can do that too, but it is\n  considered better to give theorems meaningful names.\n  After the ''shows'' keyword we give the statement to show. The \n  \\<open>\\<longleftrightarrow>\\<close> symbol denotes the equivalence in Isabelle/ZF. Here\n  we want to show that \"A is disjoint with B iff and only if B is disjoint \n  with A\". To prove this fact we show two implications - the first one that \n  \\<open>A {is disjoint with} B\\<close> implies \\<open>B {is disjoint with} A\\<close>\n  and then the converse one. Each of these implications is formulated\n  as a statement to be proved and then proved in \n  a subproof like a mini-theorem.\n  Each subproof uses a proof block to show the implication. Proof blocks\n  are delimited with curly brackets in Isar. \n  Proof block is one of the constructs that\n  does not exist in informal mathematics, so it may be confusing. \n  When reading a proof containing a proof block I suggest to focus first \n  on what is that we are proving in it. This can be done by looking\n  at the first line or two of the block and then at the last statement. \n  In our case the block starts with \n  \"assume \\<open>A {is disjoint with} B\\<close> and the last statement\n  is \"then have \\<open>B {is disjoint with} A\\<close>\". It is a typical pattern \n  when someone needs to prove an implication: one assumes the antecedent\n  and then shows that the consequent follows from this assumption.\n  Implications are denoted with the \n  \\<open>\\<longrightarrow>\\<close> symbol in Isabelle. \n  After we prove both implications we collect them \n  using the ''moreover'' construct. The keyword ''ultimately''\n  indicates that what follows is the conclusion of the statements \n  collected with ''moreover''. The ''show'' keyword is like ''have'',\n  except that it indicates that we have arrived at the claim of the \n  theorem (or a subproof).\\<close>\n", "statement": "theorem disjointness_symmetric: \n  shows \"A {is disjoint with} B \\<longleftrightarrow> B {is disjoint with} A\"\n"}
