begin

text\<open>Suppose $r$ is a linear order on a set $A$ that has $n$ elements, 
  where $n \in\mathbb{N}$ . In the \<open>FinOrd_ZF\<close>
  theory we prove a theorem stating that there is a unique
  order isomorphism between $n = \{0,1,..,n-1\}$ (with natural order) and
  $A$. Another way of stating that is that there is
  a unique way of counting the elements of $A$ in the order increasing
  according to relation $r$. Yet another way of stating the same thing is 
  that there is a unique sorted list of elements of $A$. We will call this
  list the \<open>Enumeration\<close> of $A$.\<close>

subsection\<open>Enumerations: definition and notation\<close>

text\<open>In this section we introduce the notion of enumeration
  and define a proof context (a ''locale'' in Isabelle terms)
  that sets up the notation for writing about enumarations.\<close>

text\<open>We define enumeration as the only order isomorphism beween 
  a set $A$ and the number of its elements. We are using 
  the formula $\bigcup \{x\} = x$ to extract the only element
  from a singleton. \<open>Le\<close> is the (natural) order on natural 
  numbers, defined is \<open>Nat_ZF\<close> theory in the standard 
  Isabelle library.\<close>

definition
  "Enumeration(A,r) \<equiv> \<Union> ord_iso(|A|,Le,A,r)"

text\<open>To set up the notation we define a locale \<open>enums\<close>. In this
  locale we will assume that $r$ is a linear order on some set $X$. 
  In most applications this set will be just the set of natural numbers.
  Standard Isabelle uses $\leq $ to denote the "less or equal" relation
  on natural numbers. We will use the \<open>\<lsq>\<close> symbol to denote
  the relation $r$. Those two symbols usually look the same in the presentation,
  but they are different in the source.To shorten the notation the enumeration
  \<open>Enumeration(A,r)\<close> will be denoted as $\sigma (A)$.
  Similarly as in the \<open>Semigroup\<close> theory we will write
  $a\hookleftarrow x$ for the result of appending an element $x$ to
  the finite sequence (list) $a$. Finally,
  $a\sqcup b$ will denote the concatenation of the lists $a$ and $b$.\<close>
